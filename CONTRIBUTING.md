# Contributing to Ghost Rank

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Ghost Rank! This project explores spectral phase transitions in elliptic curve L-functions.

## Ways to Contribute

### 1. Report Issues
- **Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open an issue with:
  - Description of the problem
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected vs. actual behavior
  - Your environment (Python version, OS)

- **Questions:** Feel free to open an issue for clarification about the method or results.

### 2. Suggest Improvements
- Algorithmic optimizations
- Additional analysis or visualizations
- Documentation improvements
- New calibration data points

### 3. Extend the Research
We welcome extensions such as:
- Testing Ghost Rank on new conductor ranges
- Investigating the prime modulation hypothesis (Section 10.4)
- Exploring connections to random matrix theory
- Systematic Ghost Breeding studies

## How to Contribute Code

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your feature: `git checkout -b feature/my-improvement`
3. **Make your changes** with clear commit messages
4. **Test your changes** to ensure they work
5. **Submit a Pull Request** with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Any new dependencies noted
   - Updates to documentation if needed

## Code Style

- Python: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Include docstrings for functions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and modular

## Reporting New Monster Curves

If you discover new large-|Sha| curves using Ghost Rank:
1. Document the curve label, conductor, and |Sha|
2. Include the stability metric S(E) and diffusion D
3. Verify |Sha| using SageMath or LMFDB
4. Open an issue or PR to add to the Monster Parade!
